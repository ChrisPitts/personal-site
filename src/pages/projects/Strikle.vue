        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            On December 8, 2022, workers for the New York Times staged a one day work stoppage, citing 
            the company's failure to bargain in good faith. The workers requested that the public refrain from using any 
            NYT products, including Wordle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strikle was a labor-themed Wordle alternative designed for people who wanted to play their daily 
            Wordle, but still respect the picket line set by the NYT workers. This project was completed over the 
            course of 6 hours, and was featured on Vice Motherboard for the impact it had.
